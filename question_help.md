im having problems getting Netbeans 18 JDK 17 to work with tomcat 9. If possible can any of the module team help me with this.

I will share my screen on teams if we can book a meeting. Or I will remote desktop connect to my home computer and try to fix the issue.
Im struggling to implement the coursework and complete labs with not enough time to do it just in the session and need to finish it at home on my personal computer.
